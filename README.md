Hi, Iâ€™m Kartik Pillai. I am a Computer Science student, and am interested in Python. I am currently learning about the various functionalities of the language.    
  
The following are some Beginner's Projects done by me, along with their GitHub link.  
  
## Highlights  
  
### 1. [Reddit Post Sentiment Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/pillaikartik10/reddit-sentiment-analysis-dashboard)  
  
This is a web dashboard created using Dash Plotly, and deployed on Heroku [here](https://reddit-sentiment-app.herokuapp.com/).  
On providing a valid URL to a Reddit post, it will extract the post comments, carry out sentiment analysis on them, and show the results in a graphical form. The main Python libraries used are PRAW(Python Reddit API Wrapper), Dash Plotly, TextBlob etc.   
Source code is available [here](https://github.com/pillaikartik10/reddit-sentiment-analysis-dashboard/blob/main/reddit-demo.py).  
  
### 2. [Online Resume Maker](https://github.com/pillaikartik10/resume-maker)
  
This is a basic online resume maker created using the Python Django library, and deployed on Heroku [here](https://resume-formatter.herokuapp.com/).  
The user enters some basic details regarding themselves. The generated resume can be viewed online, or downloaded locally as a PDF file. It is a beginner's project to test out the basic Django functionalities, and thus has a substantial room for improvement.
